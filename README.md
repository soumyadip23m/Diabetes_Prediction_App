• 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

• 📌 Project Description

  We have developed this Diabetes Prediction Web Application using:

  - ✅ Streamlit for building the web interface  
  - 🐍 Spyder IDE for Python scripting and testing  
  - 📦 Anaconda Navigator for managing environments and dependencies  

  This application uses a machine learning model trained on the PIMA Diabetes dataset to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on the following medical details:

  - Number of Pregnancies  
  - Glucose Level  
  - Blood Pressure  
  - Skin Thickness  
  - Insulin Level  
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)  
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function  
  - Age  

  The user enters these inputs through a friendly web form, and the app immediately provides a prediction result stating whether the person is diabetic or not.
